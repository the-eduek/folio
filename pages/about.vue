      <p>I'm <span>Eduek Akpan-Nyah</span>, a <span>Frontend Developer</span> based in <span>Lagos, Nigeria</span>.</p>

      <p>I enjoy translating art to code, building amazing, scalable web products with optimal user experiences.</p>
        
      <p>I advocate the idea of a minimalistic and user-focused approach to design and development, providing digital solutions to real world problems. I think my superpower is being able to go through code and removing unneccesary lines of CSS.</p>
                
      <p>Ultimately, I want to gain as much knowledge and experience needed to contribute immensely to the technology ecosystem, building innovative products and improving on already existing ones.</p>

      <p>Core technologies I work with include; <span>HTML5 &amp; CSS3</span>, <span>Sass</span>, <span>Tailwind CSS</span>, <span>Vue.js</span>, <span>Nuxt.js</span>, <span>JavaScript (ES6+)</span>, <span>Greensock</span>, <span>Git &amp; GitHub</span>, <span>Firebase</span>, <span>CSS-In-JS (Vue Styled Components)</span>. I'm an intuitive designer and I am familiar with <span>Figma</span>. I have also been learning <span>TypeScript</span> and <span>Webflow</span>.</p>
                
      <p>Writing is one of my favorite things to do and I regularly write about topics I find interesting, programming concepts I have learnt so far or just writing as an oulet for my thoughts.</p>

      <p>I listen to and talk about a lot of music, mostly R&amp;B. I think Lorde's 'Melodrama' is one of the greatest albums of all time and I am pretty sure I have an elite taste in music &ndash; my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/afl6wm3hopmr64ai6wq37p32d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>spotify</span><span>spotify</span></a> to prove.</p>

      <p>When I am away from my computer and not trying to figure out a bug in my head, I am probably reading an Agatha Christie book.</p>
                
      <p>Wanna be starting something? I am currently available for collaborations, intern positions, contracts and part-time projects.</p>
